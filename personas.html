                        <p class="p">Julia is full-time Graphic Designer for Ding Tea in Orange County in Southern California. She worked at Ding Tea part time as a barista while studying for her Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Designer at California State University, Long Beach. She enjoyed making the drinks in the kitchen and often experimented with different drink combinations.<br><br>
                        Once she graduated from university, she started working as a designer in the Ding Tea headquarters. Since she has a good understanding of the many drinks at Ding Tea, Julia hopes to improve Ding Tea's website in order to expand the business.</p>

                        <p class="p"> Steven graduated from CSULB with a degree in computer science. After working for several years as a software developer, he decided to escape the 9-5 life because he lost passion in what he was doing every day. Thatâ€™s when he made the decision to return to school and get an MBA at USC as his true passion was in business. <br><br>
                        He has had many successful business ventures such as Boiling Crab, Bambu, and Cococane. Steven likes to be very hands on with his investments, which is why he only invest in things his is very passionate about. He likes working with people who are equally as passionate.

The team is composed of five students who are currently attending California State University, Long Beach, who all share a common passion for code and Computer Science. Each member are currently in their 4th year and are working toward completing their undergraduate degree this year. With each of them having grown up in vastly different environments, their individual experiences allowed them to develop their own unique interests for the field of CECS. <br><br>
                        Having met in a UI/UX Design Course at CSULB, each of them met to form Team Sagar, which focuses on these following fields of development: Web and mobile application design/development, Game Development, UI/UX Design and Front End development. Through the time spent working together, Team Sagar has developed an affinity toward video games and shifted their focus toward mainly video game development and designs. Team Sagar strives to utilize its well-rounded team members to deliver quality video games that provide players with unique experiences through its immersive gameplay and well-thought out lore.</p>

                        <p class="p">Hoang Nguyen was born in Torrance, Los Angeles County. He was always excelling when it came to academics and school. He graduated from CSULB with a BAS in Computer Science. Immediately after graduation, he landed a full-time job at a software development company in Irvine, CA. While working, Hoang dreaded having to come in everday and essentially become a "code monkey" for the company.<br><br>
                            Hoang was sick of not being his own boss and decided to pursue a higher education at Stanford University. At age 24, Hoang received his MAS in Computer Science from Stanford and began his journey as a CEO for his company in Los Angeles. During his lunch break, he comes to Ding Tea and orders his usual drink every single business day and leaving immediately after in a rush.</p>

Immediately after graduating, he became a lab assistant in the Department of Neurosurgery at UCLA, before making his way to a full-time position. After spending all day in the lab, he enjoys stopping by Ding Tea to get an experimental drink on his way home.<br><br>
                        Although he spends most of his time working alone in lab, Kenneth doesn't mind having as much alone time when given. He only has a few good friends, but will open up and tell them about the latest drink combination he tried. He's easy to please as long as you're willing to work with him towards a compromise. </p>
