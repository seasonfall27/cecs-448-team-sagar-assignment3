                        <p>Team Sagar is a development team based in Long Beach. The team is composed of five students who are currently attending California State University, Long Beach, who all share a common passion for code and Computer Science. Each member are currently in their 4th year and are working toward completing their undergraduate degree this year. With each of them having grown up in vastly different environments, their individual experiences allowed them to develop their own unique interests for the field of CECS. Having met in a UI/UX Design Course at CSULB, each of them met to form Team Sagar, which focuses on these following fields of development: Web and mobile application design/development, Game Development, UI/UX Design and Front End development. Through the time spent working together, Team Sagar has developed an affinity toward video games and shifted their focus toward mainly video game development and designs. Team Sagar strives to utilize its well-rounded team members to deliver quality video games that provide players with unique experiences through its immersive gameplay and well-thought out lore.</p>
